# ðŸ§© Unity 5 Shader Showcase 
(ðŸ§° Built for Unity 5's Built-in Render Pipeline)

Welcome to the **Unity 5 Shader Showcase** â€” a growing collection of stylized, animated, and VFX shaders built using **ShaderLab + HLSL**.  
Each shader is organized in its own folder, comes with example materials, and is previewed in a clean demo scene.  


Drop it into your project and start exploring cool effects immediately!


## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open any Unity 5+ project (Built-in RP)
3. Drag and extract the zip file into your project `Assets/` folder
4. Open `Unity5-ShaderShowcase-main/Scenes/ShaderDemo.unity`
5. Hit play and explore the shaders in action

> Prefer drag-and-drop? Just import the `.unitypackage` (coming soon!)
